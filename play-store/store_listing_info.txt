VPN PERMISSION DECLARATION
--------------------------
When submitting to Play Store, you'll need to declare why VPN permission is required.
Use this explanation:

"Acutis Firewall uses the VPN permission to create a local VPN tunnel for DNS filtering.
This allows the app to intercept DNS queries on the device and block access to dangerous
or inappropriate domains based on user-configured blocklists. All filtering happens
locally on the device - no traffic is routed through external servers, and no browsing
data is collected or transmitted. The VPN is used solely for parental control and
content filtering purposes."
