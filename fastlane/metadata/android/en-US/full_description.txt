Acutis Firewall is a parental control app that protects your family by blocking adult content, malware, and dangerous websites. All filtering happens locally on your device for maximum privacy.

<b>Key Features</b>

<b>Content Protection</b>
• Block adult and pornographic websites with a comprehensive blocklist
• Protect against malware and phishing attacks with real-time DNS filtering
• Optional blocking for gambling sites and social media platforms
• Works across ALL apps, not just browsers

<b>Time-Based Controls</b>
• Set daily screen time limits for specific sites or categories
• Schedule blocking during homework time, bedtime, or family hours
• Choose which days of the week rules apply

<b>Parental Controls</b>
• PIN-protect settings so children cannot disable protection
• One-tap activation with no configuration required
• Auto-start protection when device boots

<b>Privacy First</b>
• All filtering happens on your device - no data sent to external servers
• No analytics, tracking, or data collection
• DNS queries go directly to your system DNS or Cloudflare
• PIN stored with Android's encrypted storage

<b>How It Works</b>

Acutis Firewall creates a local VPN tunnel on your device to intercept DNS queries. When a blocked domain is requested, it returns "not found" - preventing the content from loading. Allowed traffic passes through normally with no slowdown.

<b>Requirements</b>
• Android 10 or higher
• No root required
• No subscription - completely free and open source
